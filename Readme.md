## Instructions

### Checking the history
* Check the repository's log
* Open the `webpage/index.html` file in your browser
* Move back to the first version of the website and refresh the page, maybe you can spot the differences!
  * Pro-tip: there is a tag for the initial version
* Now, use `git diff` to view the differences in the repository
* Move back and forth in the repository tree and check the page's evolution


### Making some changes
* Create a new branch and `checkout`
* Update the webpage's title in the `index.html` file
* Check the differences with `git diff`
* Commit your changes
* Try using `git blame` to see your modifications
* Merge your branch into master


### Extra credit
* Make several (at least 4) changes in the `index.html` file and create separate commits with each change
* Remove a commit from the last set of changes (other than the last one)
* Make an extra change to the latest commit
